"Hey there, friend! Buckle up, because we‚Äôre diving into a whirlwind adventure that blends my love for travel with my undying devotion to the queen herself, Taylor Swift! This is the first chapter of ‚ÄúEnchanted in Singapore,‚Äù a chronicle of my journey to see her on the Eras Tour.

The Spark: A Tweet From Tay

June 21st, 2023, I was on my usual bus ride, the morning noises filling the air. Today, I skipped my headphones, letting the rhythm of the engine and the chatter of passengers be the soundtrack. While I was browsing through the notifications from last night, a notification shattered the routine. Not just any notification; a tweet from Taylor Swift! My heart hammered as I unlocked my phone.

Tweet: The Eras Tour was going international! The dates sprawled across the screen like a neon dream. And there it was ‚Äì Singapore! March 2nd, 3rd, and 4th!

Could this be it? The chance to see my idol, the most captivating woman on Earth, light up a stage miles away? A smile stretched across my face. I glanced towards my friend (a longtime crush), who was sharing the ride with me, hoping to share the excitement. She was really focused on her newspaper, her forehead wrinkled in concentration.

Sharing the Dream (Maybe Not)

‚ÄúHey, guess what?‚Äù I blurted out, unable to contain my enthusiasm any longer. She lowered the paper, a questioning look in her eyes. I launched into a passionate explanation ‚Äì Taylor‚Äôs tour, Singapore, the chance to see her live! As I spoke, I watched a flicker of something cross her face ‚Äì amusement? Disinterest? It was hard to tell exactly, but her smile was genuine.

The Ticket Conundrum

Singapore! Taylor! The Eras Tour! It was a Swiftie‚Äôs dream come true. But a nagging voice whispered a concern ‚Äì tickets. Notorious for selling out in seconds, scoring a ticket for this dream concert felt like winning the lottery. I really got bummed out thinking about maybe not getting a ticket.

A Spark of Hope

But then, a counter-melody played in my mind. There were presales, ticket queue strategies ‚Äì a whole battle plan for determined fans. Maybe, just maybe, with enough planning and a sprinkle of luck, I could snag that coveted ticket. The prospect reignited the spark of excitement.

Solo or Duo?

The question of my companion remained. While a concert adventure with her would be amazing, the possibility of a solo trip was both daunting and exhilarating. Part of me craved the familiar comfort of her company, the chance to maybe, just maybe, impress her with my Taylor-fueled determination and yet another part buzzed with the thrill of independence.

The Decision Looms

So here I am, caught in a whirlwind of emotions. The concert beckons, a beacon of shimmering possibility. Yet, the uncertainty of tickets hangs heavy. Do I rally a friend of mine to go together, or do I brave the solo queue and the unknown? One thing‚Äôs for sure, a decision needs to be made. Stay tuned! ‚úåÔ∏è" 

This is the 1st blog post of a series in which I will be summarising my trip to Singapore for The Eras Tour concert by Taylor Swift.
