I am someone who loves consistency. Routines? I like them. Predictability? Feels safe. Balance makes life smoother. For me, balance isn’t about keeping everything steady all the time. It’s about staying centered even when things shift. Like walking a tightrope, balance means being flexible enough to adjust my steps and still move forward. That’s the kind of balance that makes me feel grounded.


But then, there are people who enjoy unpredictability. The **MYSTERY** flavour. Sweet today, salty tomorrow, sometimes like ***pasta that turned unexpectedly tangy***, and sometimes all of it mixed just to keep you guessing. At first, this felt impossible for me.  Like trying to hug a cactus, possible, but very confusing.


How do you trust someone without consistency? Isn’t that what closeness is built on?

Here’s the twist: **maybe not**.


After some thinking (and a few reality checks), I realized people aren’t as predictable as I once thought. Yes, consistency gives stability, but unpredictability makes things alive. Without surprises, life is just a checklist. And honestly, no one remembers the checklist, but everyone remembers the random “plot twist” that threw it off.


So now, I am learning to accept unpredictability. I already knew life was full of surprises (I even wrote about it in my post [Night Changes](https://ganesh-v-gp.quarto.pub/blog/posts/night-changes/)), but now I see even the closest people can be too. I still love balance, but I have learned to leave space for surprises. People’s twists can be refreshing, like when someone you thought you knew suddenly reveals a whole new side. Instead of freezing them into a statue in my head, I am trying to see them as a story still unfolding, full of rewrites and surprise chapters. That way, their unpredictability feels less like errors and more like plot twists worth reading.


Some people call me ***the Calmer of the Storm***. Pressure? I don’t just handle it, I like it. While others panic, I am the one making tea in the middle of the mess. Maybe that’s why I am finding a balance between my steady path and someone else’s rollercoaster ride (even if sometimes it feels like the rollercoaster forgot to follow the track).


To the person who unknowingly taught me this (yes, you): thank you. You are still one of a kind, even if I can’t always predict what kind. Maybe that’s the magic.


Meanwhile, I will keep being the consistency guy: steady, calm, and sometimes surprised by the chaos that makes life more fun. And who knows? Maybe that chaos is like my cat knocking things off the table just for the drama, or like Taylor Swift looking more beautiful and elegant with age, always full of surprises, but in the end making the story way more interesting : )
