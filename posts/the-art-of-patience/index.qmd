Let's be honest, we live in a world that’s been put on fast-forward. We expect two-day shipping, instant replies, and progress that moves at the speed of light. So, when someone tells us to "be patient", it can feel like a personal attack on our very existence. It’s the ultimate paradox: you want to achieve something great, but the universe’s timeline doesn't sync with your internal clock. It’s like trying to get a cat to do anything on your schedule; it just won't happen.


It’s tempting to think that if you just push a little harder, you will get what you want faster. And maybe you will. But what kind of “faster” is it? It’s often a result that’s been begrudgingly delivered, lacking the genuine effort and heart that comes from a person who wants to do a favor, not just one who's been coerced into it. Consider a simple dinner invitation: you ask a friend to go out for a meal. You shouldn't be rushing them for an answer. If you push, you might get a yes. But it will likely be a rushed, half-hearted affair because I believe that they were pressured into making a decision. 


The most respectful approach is to simply ask and then step back, giving them the freedom to decide. I believe tha forcing them or using guilt to get them to say yes are just manipulative traits disguised as friendship.


This is where the magic of patience comes in. It's a radical act of trust. Instead of trying to control every variable and every person, you let go just enough to give others room to breathe. When you trust a friend to manage their own time and choose when to help you, you are telling them that their genuine willingness is more important than your immediate need. It validates their autonomy and shows that you trust them to come through for you when the time is right, or perhaps even on another day entirely.


Giving people the freedom to choose when to help you or do a favor is a bit like a trust fall with a leap of faith. You are essentially betting that if your request holds real value to them, they won’t forget it. They will approach it in their own time, on their own terms, and with an enthusiasm you couldn’t possibly force. This is a beautiful, if sometimes nail-biting, lesson in relationship building. It transforms a transactional interaction ("I need this, you do this") into a truly meaningful one. 


Of course, this approach isn't without risk, but the people who genuinely value you won't take advantage of that trust. My belief is that life is long, and people will one day remember and make time for the option we provided.


As Taylor Swift says, "The best people in life are free." They are free to choose, and their choice to show up for you is the most meaningful kind of effort. So, the next time you feel the urge to push, take a deep breath and remember that sometimes the greatest things are worth waiting for, not because the universe demands it, but because true connection is built on trust, not timelines.
