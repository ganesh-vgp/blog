Welcome back to "Enchanted in Singapore," where the countdown to Taylor's Eras Tour is well and truly underway! As you may recall from my [last post](https://ganesh-v-gp.quarto.pub/blog/posts/enchanted-in-singapore-1/), my world exploded in a flurry of excitement (and a touch of panic) when Tay herself announced the Singapore leg of the tour. Seeing her live, belting out every word to "Love Story" under the night sky - it was a dream within reach, but the hurdle of those infamous concert tickets loomed large.

So, where do we go from here? we're about to dive headfirst into the thrilling world of registration for securing the ticket to see the queen herself.

### The Ticket Battle Plan

With the concert date etched into my calendar, it was time to strategize. Grabbing a ticket felt like winning the lottery, but every fan knows – there's a method to the madness. The key dates became my mantra:

**June 23rd:** Registration opens, 12 PM SGT (09:30 AM IST)

**June 28th:** Registration closes. Before the clock strikes MidnighTS ;)

**July 5th:** This date held double the anticipation. First, it was the potential arrival day for the holy grail – the presale code, emailed to the chosen few who registered successfully. Second, it marked the UOB cardholder presale, they got first dibs!

**July 7th:** The general sale. 12 PM SGT (09:30 AM IST). This was the big one, the free-for-all where every Swiftie, armed with their registration code (hopefully!), would battle it out for a chance to see Taylor live.

With these dates tattooed on my brain, I dove headfirst into research mode. Ticketmaster queue strategies, presale tips, and lucky charm recommendations – I devoured it all.  The battle lines were drawn, and I was ready to fight (metaphorically, of course) for my chance to witness Taylor's Eras Tour magic.

### Prepping for Takeoff (Sort Of)

Knowing every second counted, I took a proactive approach.  On June 23rd, the day registration opened, I wasn't going to be caught fumbling around trying to create a Ticketmaster account.  Smart move, right?  I'd already created one couple of days before, making sure all my information was filled in and ready to go.  One less hurdle to jump over in the coming ticket frenzy!

### Registration Day Jitters

June 23rd arrived, a regular Friday with the usual commute hustle. But beneath the surface, a storm of anticipation brewed. I'd set alarms at 9:20 AM and 9:25 AM, just to be sure I wouldn't miss the registration window. Even the bus ride and the office cab commute felt different – filled not with the usual routine thoughts, but with a constant loop of "what ifs" and nervous excitement. Would the Ticketmaster website crash? Would I be able to register in time? The questions swirled in my head, making the wait feel like an eternity.

### Distracted by Dreams

Reaching the office around 9:00 AM.  Normally, the cab ride was prime time for my daily dose of French on Duolingo, but Taylor's tour had completely hijacked my brain.  Even breakfast at the office dining hall was a blur. My teammates' chatter faded into background noise as I mentally rehearsed the registration process, my fingers itching to get to a computer. The clock ticked by, each second stretching into an agonizing minute.

### The Moment of Truth

Finally, at 9:20 AM, my first alarm blared, jolting me back to reality.  With a surge of adrenaline, I practically sprinted to my desk and yanked open my laptop.  Ethernet cable – connected. Ticketmaster website – loaded. Login details – punched in with lightning speed.  I held my breath, waiting for the registration portal to open.  Every passing moment felt like an eternity.

In a show of true Swiftie solidarity, I wasn't going at it alone.  I'd shared the Ticketmaster registration link with a few of my teammates, those who understood the thrill of the hunt. 

### Thriving on Pressure?

Tick...tock...tick... As the clock crept closer to 9:30 AM, the official registration time, I could practically feel the nervous energy humming in the air. My heart hammered a frantic rhythm against my ribs, and yet...there was a strange sense of exhilaration amidst the anxiety. Maybe it was the familiar comfort of deadlines, the adrenaline rush of doing things at the last minute.  A small, twisted part of me actually thrived on the pressure.  Here it was, the moment I'd been waiting for, the first hurdle in my quest to see Taylor live.  Game on!

### The Queue of Destiny (or Despair?)

With a deep breath, I hit refresh on the Ticketmaster page right at 9:30 AM.  The tension was thick enough to cut with a butter knife.  And then, like a beacon of hope, the registration button flickered to life.  A flurry of clicks later, I was in...the queue.  But what greeted me wasn't exactly what I'd envisioned.  A giant, daunting number loomed on the screen: **2,12,245**.  My stomach lurched.  Two lakh twelve thousand people ahead of me?  Was this a good sign or a cruel joke?  A wave of doubt washed over me, but a stubborn spark of determination flickered back to life.  I settled in for the long haul, prepared to wait as long as it took.  After all, never give up without a fight! - Anbu

### Strength in Numbers

Knowing that sometimes the internet have a mind of its own, I took a precautionary measure.  I enlisted the help of a few tech-savvy teammates, asking them to join the queue on their own devices.  A virtual safety net, in case my computer decided to take a nosedive at this crucial moment.

With the queue number displayed prominently on my monitor, a silent competition began.  My teammate, `Priya`, a friend with an ever-present smile, even joined in on the queue.  Sure, she wasn't quite as obsessed with Taylor as me, but her unwavering support (and perhaps a little friendly competition?) was a welcome distraction during the wait.  We exchanged nervous glances and mumbled words of encouragement, a silent pact formed between two colleagues, one a Swiftie and the other a gracious friend.

### The Queue Odyssey

The minutes ticked by like hours.  9:50 AM rolled around, then 10:00 AM.  Still, the queue number remained stubbornly high.  Doubt started to gnaw at the edges of my determination, but then, a glimmer of hope.  At precisely 10:13 AM, a time I wouldn't soon forget (after all, 13 is Taylor's lucky number and her birthday!), the queue finally smiled upon me.  The screen flickered, and I was whisked away to the registration page.  A wave of relief washed over me, so intense it almost felt like a victory lap.  With trembling fingers, I completed the registration process, a small cheer escaping my lips.  Elated, I sprang out of my chair and buzzed around to my teammates' desks, announcing the good news.  The virtual safety net had dissolved, its mission accomplished with a collective sigh of relief and a high five with Priya.  This first hurdle was crossed!

### Confirmation Email Cliffhanger

However, the rollercoaster ride wasn't quite over.  Back at my desk, I scrolled through Twitter, a nervous habit.  That's when I saw it - tweets from fellow Swifties, jubilant about receiving confirmation emails for their registrations.  My heart lurched.  Had I done something wrong?  Was my registration lost in the digital ether?  A fresh wave of anxiety washed over me, threatening to drown the  earlier euphoria.

Just as despair started to creep in, a beautiful chime broke through the tension. It was 11:09 AM, and an email notification popped up on my screen! My pulse quickened as I clicked on it.  And there it was, the subject line that sent shivers down my spine: *"Thanks for registering for Taylor Swift | The Eras Tour"*.  Relief flooded my system, sweet and warm.  I had done it!  I had officially thrown my name into the ticket lottery, a tiny step closer to witnessing the magic of Taylor live.  The wait for the actual sale was nerve-wracking to be sure, but for now, I allowed myself a moment of pure, unadulterated joy.

### A Spark of Camaraderie (and Maybe More?)

The evening commute home felt lighter, fueled by the weight lifted from my shoulders.  As I regaled my compagnons de voyage, my trusty confidante, with tales of the day's events, I was surprised by a shift in their demeanor.  Gone was the lukewarm response from before.  This time, they were actively engaged, peppering me with questions and even chiming in with words of encouragement.  Could it be that the drama of the registration process had ignited a tiny spark of curiosity within them?  Perhaps the prospect of a unique adventure to Singapore, fueled by my enthusiasm and the chance to explore a new city together with someone I secretly harbored a huge crush on (besides my love for Taylor, of course!), was a little more appealing than initially thought?

### The Waiting Game

With the registration confirmed, the wait for July 5th stretched before me like an eternity.  Would Taylor bless me with a coveted presale code?  Would I even manage to snag a ticket during the general sale?  So many questions hung in the air, unanswered.  But amidst the uncertainty, a flicker of hope remained.  I had taken the first step, and the possibility of belting out "Love Story" under the Singapore night sky with her by my side – well, that was a dream worth fighting for.

### My life & Taylor: 02

Coordinating my phone and laptop wallpapers is an art form I've perfected.  It's all about creating a cohesive Taylor Swift aesthetic, a little world on my screens that reflects my unwavering fandom. 

These aren't just pretty pictures, they're emotional anchors.  A well-chosen Taylor Swift wallpaper has the power to shift my mood in an instant.  Feeling stressed? Need a pick-me-up?  A smiling picture of Taylor might do the trick.

The quest for the perfect Taylor Swift wallpaper is never truly over.  New eras bring new visuals, and with them, the exciting challenge of finding the perfect image to represent that chapter on my screens.  It's a never-ending journey, but one I wouldn't trade for anything.

My screensavers haven't escaped the Eras Tour takeover either!  Imagine a dazzling slideshow cycling through stunning concert photos, glimpse of Taylor's iconic outfits.  It's a constant reminder of the concert I'm (hopefully!) going to, fueling the anticipation with every screen activation.
