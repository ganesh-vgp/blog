I am someone who loves consistency. Routines? I like them. Predictability? Feels safe. Balance makes life smoother, and willl admit, I prefer things steady. If life were a TV series, I would still watch it with subtitles, but without bothering about a release schedule or checking the episode guide in advance. (I like going with the flow.)


But then, there are people who enjoy unpredictability. The **MYSTERY** flavour. Sweet today, salty tomorrow, sometimes like *pasta that turned unexpectedly tangy*, and sometimes all of it mixed just to keep you guessing. At first, this felt impossible for me.  Like trying to hug a cactus, possible, but very confusing.


How do you trust someone without consistency? Isn’t that what closeness is built on?

Here’s the twist: **maybe not**.


After some thinking (and a few reality checks), I learned that people aren’t just what we assume. Yes, consistency gives stability, but unpredictability makes things alive. Without surprises, life is just a boring to-do list. And honestly, no one remembers the to-do list, but everyone remembers the random “plot twist” that ruined it.


So now, I am learning to accept unpredictability. It doesn’t mean I have stopped loving balance, it just means I leave some space for surprises. Even random glitches can bring fresh fun.. like when a video game bug suddenly helps you win without trying.


Some people call me ***the Calmer of the Storm***. Pressure? I don’t just handle it, I like it. While others panic, I am the one making tea in the middle of the mess. Maybe that’s why I’m finding a balance between my steady path and someone else’s rollercoaster ride (even if sometimes it feels like the rollercoaster forgot to follow the track).


To the person who unknowingly taught me this (yes, you): thank you. You are still one of a kind, even if I can’t always predict what kind. Maybe that’s the magic.


Meanwhile, I will keep being the consistency guy: steady, calm, and sometimes surprised by the chaos that makes life more fun. And who knows? Maybe that chaos is like my cat knocking things off the table just for the drama, or like Taylor Swift looking more beautiful and elegant with age, always full of surprises, but in the end making the story way more interesting.
