*Before you read, take a few minutes to watch Ed Sheeran’s Perfect music video. It’s a simple, beautiful story that really sets the mood for what I want to share here.*

I have been wanting to write about this for a long time. *Perfect* by Ed Sheeran isn’t just a song I have listened to over and over, it’s a little story that’s stayed with me. And every time I watch the music video, it feels like I am revisiting a feeling I didn’t quite know how to describe until now.

The video is simple, quiet and tender. A group of friends goes on a snowy mountain trip, there’s laughter, skiing, pizza and the comfort of being with people you know well. But woven into all of it is a love story that feels so real, so familiar, it almost sneaks up on you.

It’s in the way Ed and the girl he’s with slowly start orbiting closer, not with grand gestures, but with little things. **Glances. Shared moments. A scarf pulled close.** And of course, the moment where he sings to her, softly, *“I found a love, to carry more than just my secrets.”* That line hits me every time. Because that’s what real love feels like, the kind where you can be vulnerable, messy, fully yourself and still feel held.

The snowy setting somehow makes it even warmer. Outside, everything is quiet and still. Inside, there’s firelight, music, soft smiles. And then comes that simple, unforgettable line: *“Darling, you look perfect tonight.”* It’s not said to impress. It’s said with quiet wonder, like **he still can’t believe he gets to be the one beside her.**

Another lyric that stays with me is, *“We are still kids, but we're so in love, fighting against all odds.”* It’s that sweet recognition that **love doesn’t need to be polished or perfect, it just needs to be real**. The kind where you might not have everything figured out, but you know this person makes you feel safe and seen.

Watching the video feels less like entertainment and more like watching someone’s favorite memory play out. It made me think of the moments I have had or hoped for, where love felt like home. No big speeches. Just food, laughter, music and **someone who sees you exactly as you are.**

It’s a reminder that love isn’t always loud. Sometimes, it’s just sitting across from someone, sharing food, a song and **a look that says, “I am happy it’s you.”**
